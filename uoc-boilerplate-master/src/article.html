                In a global context marked by the climate crisis, resource scarcity, and the urgent need to transform our production and consumption models, the circular economy
                in 2025 stands not just as a viable alternative, but as an essential necessity. Unlike the traditional linear model — extract, produce, consume, and discard — the
                circular economy offers a regenerative approach that aims to maintain the value of products, materials, and resources in the economy for as long as possible, minimizing waste generation.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                This model encourages innovation in product design, business strategies, and consumer behavior. Companies are rethinking how they manufacture goods, shifting toward
                modular design, materials that can be easily recycled or reused, and systems that facilitate repair, refurbishment, and remanufacturing. At the same time, consumers
                are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their choices, favoring services over ownership, and supporting brands that align with sustainable values.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Public policy also plays a pivotal role. Governments and international organizations are implementing regulations and incentives to accelerate the transition to a circular
                economy — from extended producer responsibility schemes to green public procurement practices. In 2025, these measures are becoming more harmonized across regions, creating
                a framework where environmental and economic goals are aligned. As a result, the circular economy is not only an environmental imperative but also a driver of competitiveness,
                resilience, and inclusive growth.

            <h2 class="text-2xl 2xl:text-2xl 2xl:text-4xl font-semibold mb-2">Resource Efficiency and Strategic Resilience</h2>
            <p>
                Implementing this model in 2025 is especially critical for several reasons.
                Firstly, the pressure on natural resources continues to rise. Many key materials for the tech industry, such as lithium and rare earth elements, are limited and
                subject to geopolitical tensions. Adopting circular principles, such as advanced recycling and eco-design, helps reduce dependency on virgin raw materials and
                mitigate associated supply risks.

        <p class="mb-4">
            Secondly, the circular economy represents an opportunity for sustainable economic innovation and growth.
            Companies that redesign their products to be repairable, reusable, or recyclable can stand out in the market, reduce long-term costs, and meet the growing social
            demand for responsible practices. In 2025, many consumers already prioritize brands that are committed to sustainability, making circularity a competitive advantage.

        <h2 class="text-2xl 2xl:text-4xl font-semibold mb-2">Climate Change Mitigation</h2>
        <p>
            Moreover, the circular economy plays a key role in combating climate change. According to data from the United Nations Environment Programme, over 50% of global greenhouse
            gas emissions are linked to resource extraction and processing. Circularity enables the decoupling of economic growth from resource consumption, making it a crucial tool to
            achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.

        <p class="mb-4">
            Finally, applying the circular economy in 2025 also involves a cultural transformation. It promotes a shift in mindset where use is valued over ownership, cross-sector collaboration
            is encouraged, and more conscious citizenship is fostered. Governments, businesses, and individuals all play a vital role in this transition, which requires proper public policies,
            technological innovation, and active participation.
